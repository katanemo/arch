Listener
---------
Listener is a top-level primitive in Arch - which simplifies the configuration required to bind incoming 
connections from downstream clients, and for egress connections to LLMs (hosted or API)

Arch builds on Envoy's Listener subsystem to streamline connection managemet for developers. Arch minimizes 
the complexity of Envoy's listener setup by using best-practices and exposing only essential settings, 
making it easier for developers to bind connections without deep knowledge of Envoy’s configuration model. This 
simplification ensures that connections are secure, reliable, and optimized for performance.

Downstream (Ingress)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Developers can define Arch Listeners to accept connections from downstream clients. 
A listener acts as the primary entry point for incoming traffic, handling initial connection setup, including network 
filtering, gurdrails, and additional network security checks. For more details on prompt security and safety, 
see :ref:`here <arch_overview_prompt_handling>`

Upstream (Egress)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Arch automatically configures a listener to route requests for prompts originating from your application to 
upstream LLM API providers (or hosts). When you start Arch, it creates a listener for egress traffic based on 
the presence of the ``llm_providers`` configuration section in the ``prompt_config.yml`` file. Arch binds itself 
to a local address such as ``127.0.0.1:9000/v1`` or a DNS-based address like ``arch.local:9000/v1`` for outgoing 
traffic. For more details on LLM providers, read :ref:`here <llm_providers>`
   
Configure Listener
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

To configure a Listner, simply add the ``listener`` directive to your ``prompt_config.yml`` file:

.. literalinclude:: /_config/getting-started.yml
    :language: yaml
    :linenos: 
    :lines: 1-18
    :emphasize-lines: 2-5
    :caption: :download:`arch-getting-started.yml </_config/getting-started.yml>`

Arch’s dependency on Envoy’s Listener subsystem provides a powerful, developer-friendly interface for managing connections, 
enhancing the overall efficiency of handling prompts and routing them to the correct endpoints within a generative AI application.
