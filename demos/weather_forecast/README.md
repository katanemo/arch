1. Start grafana and prometheus using following command
   ```yaml
   docker compose --profile monitoring up
   ```
2. Navigate to http://localhost:3000/ to open grafana UI (use admin/grafana as credentials)

## Tracing

To see a tracing dashboard follow instructions below,

1. For Jaeger, you can either use the default run_demo.sh script or run the following command:

```sh
sh run_demo.sh jaeger
```

2. For Logfire, first make sure to add a LOGFIRE_API_KEY to the .env file. You can either use the default run_demo.sh script or run the following command:

```sh
sh run_demo.sh logfire
```

3. For Signoz, you can either use the default run_demo.sh script or run the following command:

```sh
sh run_demo.sh signoz
```

If using Jaeger, navigate to http://localhost:16686/ to open Jaeger UI

If using Signoz, navigate to http://localhost:3301/ to open Signoz UI

If using Logfire, navigate to your logfire dashboard that you got the write key from to view the dashboard

### Stopping Demo
